##Idea
The idea behind this project was to better learn Java, XML, CSS, Ai, Neural Networks, and Android App development.
So far, there are these game modes:
  * Player vs Player
  * Player vs CPU (includes minimax algorithm)

And later when I finish the Neural Network I will add:
  * Player vs Neural Net
  * Neural Net vs CPU


In Progess:
Currently I am working on adding a neural network to play against the player/cpu.
I will be using a library initially, and then once I have a working prototype, I will
write my own neural network.


##Build
This app uses android sdk 23 as the minimum build. 
To build this app using Android Studio, start a new project, and add the files from 
```
app/src/main/java/com/arenjae/tictactoe
```
